# Food Truck Locator

This project enables people search for food truck closest to their geo-location.

There are three components to the project:

1. **FoodTruckService** - which provides an API for retrieving top five geo-coordinations as JSON
2. **Ftl-Cli** - Which enables users to search for food truck using Python CLI
3. **FoodTruckWeb** - A simple front-end that enables users to search and visually locate the food truck using Google MAP API

## Architecture
